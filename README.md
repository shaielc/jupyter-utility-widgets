# python-utility

Seeing I have been using a few widgets "patterns" over and over, I have decided to share and pack them in a convenient manner.

## Installation

`pip install jupyter-utility-widgets`

may require jupyterlab installation.

## Widgets

1. Index Selector
    A simple combination of widgets that help exploring a list of options.  
    see `examples/index_selector.ipynb`
2. File Selector
    A combination of widgets that help exploring the file system
    see `examples/file_selector.ipynb`
3. Spectrogram Viewer
