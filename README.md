# python-utility

Seeing I have been using a few "patterns" over and over, I have decided to share and package them in a convenient project.

## Installation

`pip install jupyter-utility-widgets`

may require jupyterlab installation.

## Widgets

1. Index Selector
    
    A simple combination of widgets that helps in exploring a list of options.
    see `examples/index_selector.ipynb`
